# Halo Coding Challenge Frontend
Its deployed through netlify here: https://laughing-hoover-481394.netlify.com/

Python backend can be found [here](https://github.com/pruales/halo-backend). 

This frontend was made with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and React. I used the material ui component library. 
API calls are made using axios and it uses localstorage for the JWT token.
